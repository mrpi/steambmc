# steambmc
This project is aimed at giving Kodi (Formerly XBMC) the ability to launch steam games that you have locally on your machine.

### Features that are desired
- [ ] Provide Steam ID to use to get list of games associated with that ID
- [ ] Check to see which games have been isntalled on the system and which ones are not installed (This info can then be shown to the user in some way)
- [ ] Ability to add non-steam games to the plugin. Thus allowing you to launch other games.
- [ ] Add a way for the games to be added through a user interface and grab the correct images, etc.
- [ ] Present all the games in a user friendly manner and possibly provide different views (list with info, thumbnails, etc.)
